# CodeJockRichEditorToolbar Library

The Rich Edit Control class built into DataFlex offers formatted text with the pre-programmed formatting options of Bold, Italic and Underline for Windows applications. With the DataFlex RTF Toolbar Library these functions can be extended with:

- Font choice
- Color choice
- Super & Subscript
- Ordered and unordered lists with several bullet types
- Indenting and outdenting
- Strike-through
- Find & Find and replace

These functions optimize the readability of texts and makes it easier to adapt texts to clients brand guidelines.

This library contains classes, objects and ICO files to build a RTF ButtonBar and a RTF TypeFace Bar in your applications. The Toolbar uses the CodeJock CommandBars as their superclass.
